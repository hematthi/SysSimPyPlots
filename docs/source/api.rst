Detailed API
============

Here, we provide detailed documentation for *many* of the functions that you may find useful when using SysSimPyPlots. They are organized into the following modules:

- `general.py`

   Includes a collection of fundamental constants and functions, as well as some statistical and other miscellaneous functions.

- `load_sims.py`

   Contains the big functions for loading, processing, and manipulating the simulated catalogs.

- `compare_kepler.py`

   Contains the functions for loading and processing the Kepler catalogs, as well as functions for comparing catalogs (computing distances).

- `plot_catalogs.py`

   Includes many functions for plotting figures for visualizing the catalogs and their properties.

- `plot_params.py`

   Includes some functions for plotting model parameter spaces. Also includes functions for loading files containing many evaluations of model parameters.

- `compute_RVs.py`

   Contains functions for computing, simulating, and fitting radial velocity observations of the simulated planetary systems.
